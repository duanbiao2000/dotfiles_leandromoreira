# Dotfiles for Mac/Ubuntu

My config files (zsh and vim mostly) for Mac/Ubuntu *unix. I have only tested this on ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04, MacOS 10.7.4, 10.8.2, 10.8.4, 10.9.1 and 10.14.5 (mojave).

# Prerequisites
  * git installed and change .gitconfig file for your user and email
  * for mac: homebrew
  * iterm2 installed

# What it'll install/do
  * nvim (and all plugins)
  * oh-my-zsh (steeef theme)
  * mackup (restore)

# TODO
 * remove all the .files and maybe put them on proper folder
 * change logic to .bashrc instead of .bash_profile
 * find a way to install docker/docker-compose on macos
